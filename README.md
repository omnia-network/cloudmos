# Services

## Dataflow between services

![Dataflow between services](infra.drawio.png)

Every services are nodejs applications written in typescript. They are deployed using docker. Both databases are PostgreSQL deployed on GCP.

## Deploy Website

Website to deploy on Akash. It is using the Next.js framework. The data shown in the website comes from a combination of our [API](#api) and akash nodes (REST).

Url: [deploy.cloudmos.io](https://deploy.cloudmos.io)  
Directory: [deploy-web](/deploy-web/)

## Provider Proxy

Used in the deploy website to proxy requests to providers. Needed since it's not possible to use the cert authentication system from the browser.

This is the equivalent of the [Proxy](https://github.com/akash-network/console/tree/main/proxy) used by the akash console.

Directory: [provider-proxy](/provider-proxy/)

## API

Provides data to the deploy website. The data is fetched from our Indexer database + coingecko for market data. This api also provide the endpoint for the [Web3 Index](https://web3index.org/) integration.  

Url: [api.cloudmos.io](https://api.cloudmos.io)  
Directory: [api](/api/)

## Indexer

Fetch the latest blocks from RPC nodes. Saves the blocks & stats to our Indexer Database. For details on how the indexer work see the [Indexer README](./indexer/README.md)  

Directory: [indexer](/indexer/)

## Landing Page

Small landing page with button to "Launch App".

Url: [cloudmos.io](https://cloudmos.io/)  
Directory: [landing](/landing/)

## Config

Directory containing public config file that are fetch by the deploy tool. This is to allow modifying some configurations on the spot without the need to redeploy the web interface.

Directory: [config](/config/)

# Monitoring
- [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) is integrated into all our services and allows us to catch js exceptions in the frontend as well as backend.
- [HealthChecks.io](https://healthchecks.io) is used to monitor the execution of our [Scheduled Tasks](./indexer/README.md#scheduled-tasks). If a task is failing we get an email + alert in discord.
- [Cronitor](https://cronitor.io) is used to monitor uptime. If our website or apis goes offline we get an email + alert in discord.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.net) dashboards allows us to see usage stats and syncing status. We can monitor block syncing and scheduled task there.
- **Status Endpoints**  
  All our backend services have `/status` endpoints built into them allowing us to monitor health and view usage stats. Those endpoints are use by the other monitoring tools.

# Running the Application

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the application, including steps for manual database restoration and using Docker Compose for ease of setup.

## Manual Database Restoration

Due to the extensive time required to index Akash from block #1, it's recommended to initialize your database using an existing backup for efficiency. This approach is particularly beneficial for development purposes.

### Available Backups

- **Mainnet Database (~30 GB):** [cloudmos-akash-mainnet.sql.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudmos-postgresql-backups/cloudmos-akash-mainnet.sql)
  - Suitable for scenarios requiring complete data.
- **Sandbox Database (< 300 MB):** [cloudmos-akash-sandbox.sql.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudmos-postgresql-backups/cloudmos-akash-sandbox.sql.gz)
  - Ideal for most development needs, although it may lack recent chain updates.

### Restoration Steps

1. Create a PostgreSQL database.
2. Restore the database using `psql`. Ensure PostgreSQL tools are installed on your system.

For a .sql.gz file:
```sh
gunzip -c /path/to/cloudmos-akash-sandbox.sql.gz | psql --host "localhost" --port "5432" --username "postgres" --dbname "cloudmos-akash"
```
After restoring the database, you can proceed with the specific project's README instructions for further setup and running the application.

### Using Docker Compose
For convenience, a Docker Compose configuration is provided to automate the database setup, download, and data import process.

#### Configuration
1. Ensure environment variables are set in .postgres.local.env. This file configures PostgreSQL and import settings.
2. The `POSTGRES_DBS_FOR_IMPORT` variable should be updated with the databases you wish to import. This is a comma-separated list with potential values including `cloudmos-akash-sandbox` (default) and `cloudmos-akash-2` (mainnet). Leave this variable empty if no import is desired.

#### Running Docker Compose
```sh
docker-compose up
```
This command spins up the database service and automatically handles the downloading and importing of the specified data.

# Database Structure

The database schemas is defined using [sequelize-typescript](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize-typescript) in [/shared/dbSchemas/](./shared/dbSchemas/). Models are separated into the following folders:

- **base** - Tables which are cosmos generic and are used for every chains
- **akash** - Tables which are akash specific (they are not created when initializing a database for another chain)
- **user** - Tables which are user specific. Contains tables for user settings and templates
